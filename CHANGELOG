		caused index.php to show up as blank due to a fatal error.
	Added error_reporting(E_ALL), to make errors easier to identify.
1250:
	Added two heavily requested features:
	- unless you're logged in, the top address bar doesn't show the full path, but the relative path.
	- added previous/next buttons on images for an image gallery-style effect.
1251:
	Password input in install.php is now an actual password input.
	When editing files, saving the file no longer closes the dialog, making it more suitable for programmers.
