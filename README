Tastydir - an AJAX file manager and directory listing

INSTALLATION
	Simply upload everything to a directory of your choice.
	
DOCUMENTATION
	Look at the /doc directory in your browser for detailed documentation.
	
PERMISSION PROBLEMS?
	Your PHP scripts may be running as the 'nobody' user (you can check this in the info tooltip in Tastydir).
	This is common on many shared hosts, and it means that Tastydir won't be able to edit files created with FTP.
	SOLUTION: when you upload files with FTP or via cPanel, make sure you chmod them to 777.
